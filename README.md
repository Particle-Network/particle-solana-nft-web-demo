## ⚠️ Notice

The demo uses `IndexedDB` to store centralized data, and if the associated database is deleted, the auction-related data will be lost. So we Strongly recommended running this demo by the `devnet` network.

Switching networks cleans up local db, which means that transaction-related data is lost.
